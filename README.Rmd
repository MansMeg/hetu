hetu - Structural Handling of Finnish Personal Identity Numbers
==========

### Introduction

`hetu` is an R package for structural handling of identity numbers used in the Finnish administration, in particular the personal identity numbers (henkil√∂tunnus). Some functions can also be used with Finnish Business ID numbers (y-tunnus).

The syntax in this package is unified with the similar package for Swedish ID numbers, the [sweidnumbr](https://github.com/rOpenGov/sweidnumbr).

### Installation

To install from CRAN just write:

```r
install.packages(hetu)
```

Use the `devtools` package to install the latest version from GitHub:
```r
devtools::install_github("rOpenGov/hetu")
library(hetu)
```

A tutorial is included with the package and can be viewed with:
```r
vignette("hetu")
```
